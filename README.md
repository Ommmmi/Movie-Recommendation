# Movie-Recommendation
 This project is a content-based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies similar to a userâ€™s favorite movie. It uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorization to transform text-based features into numerical representations and Cosine Similarity to calculate movie relevance. The system analyzes genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director to find and rank similar movies. 
Features

Content-based filtering using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Fuzzy matching to find the closest movie titles.

Top 30 movie recommendations based on similarity scores.

Handles missing values and optimizes data processing.

Efficient for large datasets with scalable text-based similarity computation.
